Trial 2: Results Summary

Hyperparameters: Similar to Trial 1, but with:
- Learning Rate: 0.001
- Batch Size: 64

Epoch Performance:
- Epoch 1: Loss: 0.6732 - Accuracy: 65.8%
- Epoch 5: Loss: 0.4185 - Accuracy: 82.1%
- Epoch 10: Loss: 0.3669 - Accuracy: 85.7%

Observations:
- More gradually declining loss due to lower learning rate.
- Marginal improvement in final accuracy over Trial 1.
- Confirmed importance of tuning learning rates.

Conclusion:
Lowering the learning rate allowed for more stable convergence, guiding towards a slightly higher accuracy point, awaiting further trials for confirmation.

Old Trial 1: Initial Notes

1. Initial Approach:
   - Basic network structure 
   - Learning Rate: 0.05
   - Batch Size: 16
   - 5 Epochs

2. Results:
   - Rapid initial dips in loss but plateau quickly.
   - Accuracy was inconsistent, peaking early at 70%.

3. Key Takeaways:
   - Overfitting observed rapidly, potentially due to high learning rate.
   - Smaller batch sizes introduced high variance in gradient updates.
   - Early stopping point noted to prevent unnecessary computation.

Observations set the groundwork for refinement in subsequent trials.
Encouraging more explorative parameter tuning.

Legacy Summary: Insights from Historical Trials

1. Overview:
   - Collection of multiple early trials and their outcomes.
   - Emphasis on parameter exploration and initial learning curves.

2. Key Findings:
   - Hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size significantly impact stability and convergence.
   - Regularization techniques were explored, introducing dropout with mixed outcomes.
   - Model benefited from deeper layers but required careful tuning to avoid overfitting.

3. Recommendations:
   - Thorough experimentation with smaller learning rates.
   - Monitor validation performance to catch overfitting early.
   - Explore advanced activation functions for potential gains.

Legacy knowledge serves as a beacon leading future innovation.
